QTP 10 has many features that make it a powerful and versatile tool for automated testing. Some of these features are:
 
- Record and playback: QTP 10 can record user actions on the application under test and generate test scripts that can be replayed later. This helps testers to create test cases quickly and easily.
- Keyword-driven testing: QTP 10 can also use keywords to define test steps and actions. Keywords are predefined commands that represent common operations such as clicking a button, entering data, or verifying a result. Testers can use keywords to create test scripts without writing code.
- Data-driven testing: QTP 10 can use external data sources such as Excel files, databases, or XML files to provide input data and expected output data for test cases. This helps testers to perform parameterization and validation of test data.
- Object repository: QTP 10 can store the properties and methods of the objects in the application under test in a centralized repository. This helps testers to identify and manipulate the objects easily and consistently.
- Checkpoints: QTP 10 can insert checkpoints in test scripts to verify the state of the application under test at a specific point. Checkpoints can compare values, text, images, tables, databases, or files.
- Recovery scenarios: QTP 10 can handle unexpected events or errors that may occur during test execution. Recovery scenarios can specify the actions to be performed when an error occurs, such as closing an application, restarting a system, or sending an email.
- Reporting: QTP 10 can generate detailed reports that show the results of test execution. Reports can include screenshots, error messages, pass/fail status, and other information.

QTP 10 is a popular tool for automated testing because it offers many benefits such as:

- Reducing manual effort and human errors
- Increasing test coverage and reliability
- Improving test efficiency and productivity
- Enhancing test maintainability and reusability
- Supporting continuous integration and delivery
